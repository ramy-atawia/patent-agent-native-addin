# Functionality Guide

Comprehensive guide to the capabilities and use cases of the Agentic Native Drafting Service.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Capabilities

### **1. Intelligent Patent Drafting**

**What it does**: Automatically generates USPTO-compliant patent claims based on invention descriptions.

**Key Features**:
- âœ… **Multi-claim Generation**: Creates independent and dependent claims
- âœ… **USPTO Compliance**: Follows patent law requirements
- âœ… **Technical Accuracy**: Maintains invention integrity
- âœ… **Context Awareness**: Uses session history for consistency

**Example Use Case**:
```
User: "Please draft patent claims for my AI-powered quantum computing system that uses machine learning to optimize qubit entanglement patterns"

Agent Response:
"I've drafted 3 patent claims based on your invention:

1. A quantum computing system comprising:
   - A plurality of qubits arranged in a quantum register
   - A machine learning module configured to analyze qubit entanglement patterns
   - A control system that dynamically adjusts qubit parameters based on ML analysis
   - An output interface for quantum computation results

### **2. Smart Claim Review & Analysis**

**What it does**: Analyzes existing patent claims for quality, compliance, and improvement opportunities.

**Key Features**:
- âœ… **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates claim structure and clarity
- âœ… **Compliance Checking**: Identifies USPTO requirement issues
- âœ… **Improvement Suggestions**: Provides actionable feedback
- âœ… **Severity Classification**: Prioritizes issues (minor/major/critical)

**Example Use Case**:
```
User: "Review these claims for quality and compliance"

Agent Response:
"I've reviewed your patent claims and found 3 issue(s):

ðŸŸ¡ **MAJOR**: Claim 1 lacks specific technical details about the machine learning algorithm implementation. Consider adding algorithm parameters and training methodology.

ðŸŸ¢ **MINOR**: Claim 2 dependency structure could be improved. Consider making it dependent on both claims 1 and 2 for better coverage.

ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Claim 3 may violate 35 USC 101 (patentable subject matter). The abstract concept of 'optimization' needs concrete technical implementation details."
```

---

### **3. LLM-Based Intent Classification**

**What it does**: Automatically understands user requests and routes them to appropriate functions.

**Supported Intent Types**:
1. **`claim_drafting`** - Generate new patent claims
2. **`claim_review`** - Review existing claims
3. **`patent_guidance`** - General patent advice
4. **`invention_analysis`** - Analyze invention patentability
5. **`technical_query`** - Answer technical questions
6. **`general_conversation`** - General chat and greetings

**Example Intent Recognition**:
```
User Input: "Can you draft some claims for my blockchain invention?"
Intent: claim_drafting (confidence: 0.95)
Reasoning: User explicitly requests drafting patent claims

User Input: "Review those claims I just showed you"
Intent: claim_review (confidence: 0.95)
Reasoning: User references previous claims and requests review

User Input: "How do I patent my AI system?"
Intent: patent_guidance (confidence: 0.9)
Reasoning: User seeks general patent process guidance
```

---

### **4. Confidence-Based Decision Making**

**What it does**: Uses confidence scores to decide between executing actions or seeking clarification.

**Decision Logic**:
- **Confidence > 0.7**: Execute the detected intent
- **Confidence â‰¤ 0.7**: Seek user clarification

**Example Scenarios**:
```
High Confidence (0.95):
User: "Draft patent claims for my quantum computer"
Action: Execute claim_drafting
Result: Generate claims immediately

Low Confidence (0.6):
User: "Something about technology maybe"
Action: Seek clarification
Result: "I'm not entirely sure what you're asking for. Could you provide more details about what you need?"
```

### **5. Advanced Session Management**

**What it does**: Maintains persistent conversation context across multiple interactions within a session.

**Key Features**:
- âœ… **Multi-turn Conversations**: Continue discussions across multiple requests
- âœ… **Context Persistence**: Remember previous claims and discussions
- âœ… **Session Isolation**: Separate contexts for different patent projects
- âœ… **History Building**: Accumulate conversation for context injection

**Example Session Flow**:
```
Session Start:
User: "Draft claims for my AI system"
Agent: Generates 3 claims

Session Continue:
User: "Review those claims"
Agent: Reviews the previously generated claims with full context

Session Continue:
User: "Improve claim 1 based on your feedback"
Agent: Improves claim 1 using both original invention and review feedback

Session Continue:
User: "How many claims do I have now?"
Agent: "You have 3 claims in this session: [lists all claims with context]"
```
