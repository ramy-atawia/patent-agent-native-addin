## RELEVANCE VALIDATION SECTION

### INCLUDED PATENTS:
- **None**: All patents found were excluded due to irrelevance to the search query.

### EXCLUDED PATENTS:
1. **Patent ID: 10000037**
   - **Title:** Transparent laminate and protective tool including the same
   - **Reason for Exclusion:** This patent pertains to a transparent laminate technology and does not relate to 5G, AI, or spectrum technologies. It focuses on materials and adhesive properties, which are outside the telecommunications and AI domains.

2. **Patent ID: 10000063**
   - **Title:** Liquid containing member
   - **Reason for Exclusion:** This patent is related to liquid supply systems for inkjet printing and does not involve any telecommunications, AI, or spectrum technologies. It focuses on mechanical aspects of liquid containment and ejection, which are irrelevant to the search query.

3. **Patent ID: 10000122**
   - **Title:** Method for operating parallel auxiliary converters in a rail vehicle
   - **Reason for Exclusion:** This patent is specifically about electrical energy supply systems for rail vehicles. It does not relate to 5G, AI, or spectrum technologies and is focused on vehicle energy management, which is outside the scope of the search.

4. **Patent ID: 10000164**
   - **Title:** Vehicle camera peripheral
   - **Reason for Exclusion:** This patent describes a camera system for vehicles, which is unrelated to telecommunications, AI, or spectrum technologies. It focuses on vehicle peripherals and wireless connections, which do not overlap with the search query.
