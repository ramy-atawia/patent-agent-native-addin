Analyze patent relevance to search query with comprehensive evaluation. Return ONLY a JSON response.

SEARCH QUERY: {search_query}
PATENT TITLE: {title}
PATENT ABSTRACT: {abstract}

Conduct thorough relevance analysis considering:

TECHNICAL RELEVANCE FACTORS:
1. Direct Technology Match: Does the patent directly address the search technology?
2. Core Innovation Alignment: How well do the patent's innovations align with the search focus?
3. Technical Approach Similarity: Are the underlying technical approaches comparable?
4. Implementation Scope: Does the patent cover the same technical scope as the search?
5. Standards Compatibility: Does the patent relate to relevant technical standards?

SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:
- Analyze technical terminology overlap
- Consider conceptual relationships between patent and search
- Evaluate innovation novelty in the context of the search
- Assess practical applicability to the search domain

RELEVANCE SCORING CRITERIA:
- 0.0-0.2: IRRELEVANT - No meaningful connection to search query
- 0.3-0.4: SLIGHT - Tangential relation, some shared terminology but different focus
- 0.5-0.6: MODERATE - Related technology area with some overlapping concepts  
- 0.7-0.8: HIGH - Strong technical alignment with clear relevance to search
- 0.9-1.0: EXCELLENT - Direct match with high innovation overlap

Return ONLY this JSON structure:
{{
    "relevance_score": <float 0.0-1.0>,
    "reasoning": "<detailed explanation of relevance assessment considering technical alignment, innovation overlap, and practical applicability>",
    "key_alignment_factors": ["<factor1>", "<factor2>", "<factor3>"],
    "technical_overlap_level": "<NONE|LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH>",
    "innovation_relevance": "<NOT_RELEVANT|TANGENTIAL|RELATED|HIGHLY_RELEVANT>"
}}

Provide comprehensive analysis focusing on technical depth and practical relevance to the search query.
