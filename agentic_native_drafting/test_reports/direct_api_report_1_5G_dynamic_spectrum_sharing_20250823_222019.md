To avoid interference between the PRSs and between the two RATs, the PRSs may be time aligned to the same set of PRS positioning occasions, and may be assigned orthogonal characteristics such as different muting patterns, orthogonal code sequences, different frequency shifts or different frequency hopping. UEs supporting both RATs may be enabled to measure PRSs for both RATs. UEs supporting only one RAT (e.g. 4G LTE) may be enabled to measure PRSs for just this RAT. A location server such as an LMF, E-SMLC or SLP may provide assistance data to UEs, and request measurements from UEs, for PRSs in one or both RATs.",

Based on the number of 5G UEs and 4G UEs, a first portion of a frequency resource can be allocated to 5G and a second portion of the frequency resource can be allocated to 4G.

The new dynamic spectrum-sharing paradigm necessitates dynamically defining and enforcing the spectrum-access rights while accommodating the dynamics of the RF environment and the spectrum-access scenarios. To enforce spectrum-access rights, emphasis is placed on capturing the use of spectrum by an individual transceiver. Spectrum-access rights are articulated in terms of the characterization of the spectrum used by an individual transceiver in the space, time, and frequency dimensions. In order to estimate the use of spectrum in real time, an RF-sensor network is employed, the network uses interference-tolerant algorithms to estimate the transceiver spectrum-access parameters and to characterize the propagation environment.",

To avoid interference between the PRSs and between the two RATs, the PRSs may be time aligned to the same set of PRS positioning occasions, and may be assigned orthogonal characteristics such as different muting patterns, orthogonal code sequences, different frequency shifts or different frequency hopping. UEs supporting both RATs may be enabled to measure PRSs for both RATs. UEs supporting only one RAT (e.g. 4G LTE) may be enabled to measure PRSs for just this RAT. A location server such as an LMF, E-SMLC or SLP may provide assistance data to UEs, and request measurements from UEs, for PRSs in one or both RATs.",

For example, a base station can determine whether user equipment (UE) requesting communications at the base station are configured to operate in accordance with 4th Generation (5G) radio access technologies and/or in accordance with 5th Generation (5G) radio access technologies. Based on the number of 5G UEs and 4G UEs, a first portion of a frequency resource can be allocated to 5G and a second portion of the frequency resource can be allocated to 4G. In some examples, a first allocation strategy for a first frequency resource (e.g., Band 71) can be used to generate a second allocation strategy for a partially overlapping second frequency resource (e.g., Band 41).",

        "abstract": "In the static and exclusive spectrum allocation paradigm, the spectrum-access parameters for a service are chosen to mitigate potential harmful-interference and ensure minimum performance under worst-case conditions. The new dynamic spectrum-sharing paradigm necessitates dynamically defining and enforcing the spectrum-access rights while accommodating the dynamics of the RF environment and the spectrum-access scenarios. To enforce spectrum-access rights, emphasis is placed on capturing the use of spectrum by an individual transceiver. Spectrum-access rights are articulated in terms of the characterization of the spectrum used by an individual transceiver in the space, time, and frequency dimensions. In order to estimate the use of spectrum in real time, an RF-sensor network is employed, the network uses interference-tolerant algorithms to estimate the transceiver spectrum-access parameters and to characterize the propagation environment.",
