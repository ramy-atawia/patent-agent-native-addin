To avoid interference between the PRSs and between the two RATs, the PRSs may be time aligned to the same set of PRS positioning occasions, and may be assigned orthogonal characteristics such as different muting patterns, orthogonal code sequences, different frequency shifts or different frequency hopping. UEs supporting both RATs may be enabled to measure PRSs for both RATs. UEs supporting only one RAT (e.g. 4G LTE) may be enabled to measure PRSs for just this RAT. A location server such as an LMF, E-SMLC or SLP may provide assistance data to UEs, and request measurements from UEs, for PRSs in one or both RATs.",

Based on the number of 5G UEs and 4G UEs, a first portion of a frequency resource can be allocated to 5G and a second portion of the frequency resource can be allocated to 4G.
