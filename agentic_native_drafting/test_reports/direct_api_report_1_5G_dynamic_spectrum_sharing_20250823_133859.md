To avoid interference between the PRSs and between the two RATs, the PRSs may be time aligned to the same set of PRS positioning occasions, and may be assigned orthogonal characteristics such as different muting patterns, orthogonal code sequences, different frequency shifts or different frequency hopping. UEs supporting both RATs may be enabled to measure PRSs for both RATs. UEs supporting only one RAT (e.g. 4G LTE) may be enabled to measure PRSs for just this RAT. A location server such as an LMF, E-SMLC or SLP may provide assistance data to UEs, and request measurements from UEs, for PRSs in one or both RATs.",

Based on the number of 5G UEs and 4G UEs, a first portion of a frequency resource can be allocated to 5G and a second portion of the frequency resource can be allocated to 4G. In some examples, a first allocation strategy for a first frequency resource (e.g., Band 71) can be used to generate a second allocation strategy for a partially overlapping second frequency resource (e.g., Band 41).",

To enforce spectrum-access rights, emphasis is placed on capturing the use of spectrum by an individual transceiver. Spectrum-access rights are articulated in terms of the characterization of the spectrum used by an individual transceiver in the space, time, and frequency dimensions. In order to estimate the use of spectrum in real time, an RF-sensor network is employed, the network uses interference-tolerant algorithms to estimate the transceiver spectrum-access parameters and to characterize the propagation environment.",

Each radio node can measure a local signal value (SV) of a protected transmission and the radio nodes are within a uniform SV region of the protected transmission. The transmit decision is determined for at least one of the plurality of radio nodes based on the SV of each radio node in the plurality of radio nodes and at least one threshold value that is related to statistical characteristics of the protected transmission at an interference boundary (105) of the protected transmission and a desired probability of non-interference with the protected transmission at the interference boundary.",

To avoid interference between the PRSs and between the two RATs, the PRSs may be time aligned to the same set of PRS positioning occasions, and may be assigned orthogonal characteristics such as different muting patterns, orthogonal code sequences, different frequency shifts or different frequency hopping. UEs supporting both RATs may be enabled to measure PRSs for both RATs. UEs supporting only one RAT (e.g. 4G LTE) may be enabled to measure PRSs for just this RAT. A location server such as an LMF, E-SMLC or SLP may provide assistance data to UEs, and request measurements from UEs, for PRSs in one or both RATs.",

The new dynamic spectrum-sharing paradigm necessitates dynamically defining and enforcing the spectrum-access rights while accommodating the dynamics of the RF environment and the spectrum-access scenarios. To enforce spectrum-access rights, emphasis is placed on capturing the use of spectrum by an individual transceiver. Spectrum-access rights are articulated in terms of the characterization of the spectrum used by an individual transceiver in the space, time, and frequency dimensions. In order to estimate the use of spectrum in real time, an RF-sensor network is employed, the network uses interference-tolerant algorithms to estimate the transceiver spectrum-access parameters and to characterize the propagation environment.",
