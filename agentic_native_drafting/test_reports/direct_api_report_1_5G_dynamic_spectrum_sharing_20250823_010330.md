To avoid interference between the PRSs and between the two RATs, the PRSs may be time aligned to the same set of PRS positioning occasions, and may be assigned orthogonal characteristics such as different muting patterns, orthogonal code sequences, different frequency shifts or different frequency hopping. UEs supporting both RATs may be enabled to measure PRSs for both RATs. UEs supporting only one RAT (e.g. 4G LTE) may be enabled to measure PRSs for just this RAT. A location server such as an LMF, E-SMLC or SLP may provide assistance data to UEs, and request measurements from UEs, for PRSs in one or both RATs.",

Based on the number of 5G UEs and 4G UEs, a first portion of a frequency resource can be allocated to 5G and a second portion of the frequency resource can be allocated to 4G.

The MME then contacts a sharing entity (SE) to announce that it wants to supply spectrum for sharing. The MME obtains terms of a sharing agreement from the SE and the MME obtains the identity of the other network. In response to this information, the MME configures its base stations to support the supplying of spectrum to the other network. The SE applies knowledge of network topology and of services offered. This knowledge is obtained from a sharing database. At the expiration of the sharing agreement, the SE tells the MMEs to deactivate the sharing agreement.",

In the method, a secondary user (SU) obtains spectrum sharing scene information and requirement parameters; then initializes state parameters and spectrum sensing parameters of a channel. At the beginning of each slot, the SU determines whether a direct transmission condition is met according to the transmission condition of the previous slot, and directly continues transmission on the channel of the previous slot or obtains an idle channel according to the channel state and spectrum sensing for transmission, and updates state parameter and spectrum sensing parameter. Finally, an SU base station performs conflict coordination according to the channel occupancy condition for a fixed number of slots. Hence, low-overhead and efficient spectrum sharing is realized by the SU learning the channel state and the transmission condition, such that the spectrum utilization rate in a high user density and dynamic spectrum environment can be effectively improved.",

The MME then contacts a sharing entity (SE) to announce that it wants to supply spectrum for sharing. The MME obtains terms of a sharing agreement from the SE and the MME obtains the identity of the other network. In response to this information, the MME configures its base stations to support the supplying of spectrum to the other network. The SE applies knowledge of network topology and of services offered.
