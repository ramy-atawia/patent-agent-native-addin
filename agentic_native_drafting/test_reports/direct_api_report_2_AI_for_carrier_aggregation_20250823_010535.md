The coding rate is indirectly controlled by varying the number of RBs allocated for the CSI report transmission. Two sets of serving cells are established, and the payload of each set is approximated. For each allowable number of RBs and each payload size, a threshold SINR is determined and stored. An initial number of RBs is selected, based on the number of cells. The actual SINR is measured, and compared to the threshold SINR for the number of RBs and payload size. The number of RBs to be allocated is varied based on the comparison, by varying an index into an array of allowable numbers of RBs. Link adaptation is performed based on observed decoding errors, in an outer loop control algorithm that prevents wind up. An optimization for the particular case of one PCell and one SCell is also presented.",

The spectrum sharing problem is modeled as a fairness constrained mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem, by jointly determining dynamic channel selection, carrier aggregation and fractional spectrum access for the first wireless networks, while guaranteeing fair spectrum access for the coexisting wireless network based on a cross-technology fairness criterion. An algorithm based on a combination of branch and bound and successive convex relation techniques is provided to optimally solve the problem, i.e., maximize the utility of the first wireless network with guaranteed optimality precision that can be set arbitrarily at the expense of computational complexity. The coexistence scheme requires no signaling exchange between the first wireless network and the coexisting wireless network, and does not require any changes to the communication protocol stack of the coexisting wireless network.",

        "title": "Efficient transmission of stand-alone aperiodic CSI reporting for LTE carrier aggregation",
        "abstract": "The transmission of stand-alone, aperiodic CSI reports from a UE in carrier aggregation in an LTE network is optimized. The coding rate is indirectly controlled by varying the number of RBs allocated for the CSI report transmission. Two sets of serving cells are established, and the payload of each set is approximated. For each allowable number of RBs and each payload size, a threshold SINR is determined and stored. An initial number of RBs is selected, based on the number of cells. The actual SINR is measured, and compared to the threshold SINR for the number of RBs and payload size. The number of RBs to be allocated is varied based on the comparison, by varying an index into an array of allowable numbers of RBs. Link adaptation is performed based on observed decoding errors, in an outer loop control algorithm that prevents wind up. An optimization for the particular case of one PCell and one SCell is also presented.",

        "abstract": "Peak to average power ratio (PAPR) reduction with respect to signals of component carriers of a carrier aggregation configuration may be provided using preconfigured or fixed PRT location sequences (e.g., fixing the number and location of PRTs). A device transmitting signals of component carriers of a carrier aggregation configuration may perform PRT magnitude and phase optimization processing with respect to PRTs of a PRT location sequence using techniques, such as may use a signal to clipping noise ratio, tone reservation (SCR-TR) algorithm. Various PRT location sequence configurations, such as PRT sideband location sequence configurations, PRT inband location sequence configurations, etc., may be selected to facilitate reduction of PAPR associated with the data tones of one or more carrier aggregation component carriers, such as to satisfy a PAPR threshold. Other aspects and features are also claimed and described.",

        "abstract": "A coexistence scheme enables spectrally-efficient and fair spectrum sharing between a first wireless network and a coexisting wireless network in the same frequency bands. The spectrum sharing problem is modeled as a fairness constrained mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem, by jointly determining dynamic channel selection, carrier aggregation and fractional spectrum access for the first wireless networks, while guaranteeing fair spectrum access for the coexisting wireless network based on a cross-technology fairness criterion. An algorithm based on a combination of branch and bound and successive convex relation techniques is provided to optimally solve the problem, i.e., maximize the utility of the first wireless network with guaranteed optimality precision that can be set arbitrarily at the expense of computational complexity. The coexistence scheme requires no signaling exchange between the first wireless network and the coexisting wireless network, and does not require any changes to the communication protocol stack of the coexisting wireless network.",

An optimized network roll-out plan may be determined for a mobile network comprising sectors fitted with multiple cells operating over respective carrier frequencies by gathering data from several network counters, and analyzing the data to derive the network roll-out plan. Analyzing the data comprises applying congestion detection based on a probability mass function (PMF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) modelling; and assessing based on the congestion detection achievable data throughput for users in a particular sector. The congestion detection comprises assessing at least one carrier aggregation (CA) scenario for the particular sector, between two or more cells providing coverage in the sector; and detecting for the at least one carrier aggregation (CA) scenario, a congestion situation based on predefined percentile of an aggregated CDF curve weighted based on probabilities of possible cell connection configurations, and a predefined minimal throughput level.",
